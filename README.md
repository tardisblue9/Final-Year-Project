# Final-Year-Project
Done in 2020-2021, at City University of Hong Kong, Mathematics Department.

This is a final year project on the topic: Applying Deep Learning to Text Classification.

We resolve a Chinese text classification problem, which is also known as Readability. We apply multiple deep learning approaches
including fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural network models, as well as the attention mechanism. Different innovative
techniques are applied to improve readability in traditional settings.

This work is later transferred to a research paper published on *Mathematical Foundations of Computing* 2022. Feng, Han, Sizai Hou, Le-Yin Wei, and Ding-Xuan Zhou. "CNN models for readability of Chinese texts." Mathematical Foundations of Computing 5, no. 4 (2022).
